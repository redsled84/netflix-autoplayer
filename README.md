# netflix_autoplayer
Basic python script that autoplays any Netflix TV show until it's over. I created this because I'm too lazy to consistently move 5 feet to unpause the "Are you still watching?" pop-up.

# Usage
```bash
python netflix_autoplayer
```

# Dependencies
* PyAutoGUI v0.9.50

To install PyAutoGui after cloning, either use ```pip install pyautogui``` or ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

*Netflix has to be fullscreen and playing a TV show in order for this script
to work as intended. I wouldn't use this on a movie because that would be
outside this script's intended use case.*
